It also allows for reusability of functions in instances where the code might need to be modified for a different use case. It also means that the code is easier to test and debug.",

For instance, 10 objects provide 27 pairings. If we have a list containing 28 pairings,\nthen we end up with a non-integer number of objects, which is impossible.
